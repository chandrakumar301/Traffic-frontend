📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS TO FIX 404 ERROR ON VERCEL

✅ WHAT I'VE DONE:
1. Updated vercel.json with correct rewrites configuration
2. Verified vite.config.ts has base: "/"
3. Confirmed npm run build works locally

🚀 NOW YOU NEED TO DO:

STEP 1: Push updated files to GitHub
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```powershell
cd "c:\traffic work\Traffic-control--main\Traffic-control--main"
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel 404 error - add correct rewrites in vercel.json"
git push origin main
```

STEP 2: Go to Vercel Dashboard
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Open https://vercel.com
2. Click your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Find the FAILED deployment (red X)
5. Click the "..." menu on that deployment
6. Select "Redeploy"
   OR
   Go to Settings → Find "Redeploy Now" button

STEP 3: Wait for Deployment
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Watch the deployment complete (should take 30-60 seconds)
- Green checkmark = Success ✓
- Red X = Still failed

STEP 4: Test Your App
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Visit: https://your-project.vercel.app
- Try homepage: Should load ✓
- Try other routes: Should also work ✓

❌ IF STILL GETTING 404:

1. Check Vercel Build Logs:
   - Click on failed deployment
   - Scroll to "Build Log"
   - Look for error messages
   - Screenshot and share with me

2. Common issues:
   ❌ Build Command Error → npm run build failed
   ❌ Output Directory → dist folder not found
   ❌ Missing Dependencies → npm install failed

3. Emergency Fix - Delete and Redeploy:
   - Go to Settings → scroll down
   - Click "Clear Build Cache"
   - Click back to Deployments
   - Click "Redeploy"

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your Backend WebSocket

Your app connects to: ws://localhost:3001

When deployed, localhost won't work!

You need to:
1. Deploy backend to: Render, Railway, or Fly
2. Get backend URL: https://your-backend.example.com
3. Update frontend to use it

For now, test on localhost first:
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run dev
```

Then test at: http://localhost:8082

✅ Verification Checklist:

☐ vercel.json updated with rewrites
☐ Changes pushed to GitHub
☐ Redeployed on Vercel
☐ Checked deployment status (green check)
☐ Tested homepage loads
☐ Tested other routes load
☐ Checked browser console for errors (F12)

---

If deployment is STILL failing after these steps, share:
1. Your Vercel project URL
2. Screenshot of Build Log error
3. Output of: npm run build (local terminal)

I'll help debug further!
